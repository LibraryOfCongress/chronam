<h3>What is OCR?</h3>

<p>
Optical character recognition (OCR) is a fully automated process 
that converts the visual image of numbers and letters into 
computer-readable numbers and letters. Computer software can then 
search the OCR-generated text for words, phrases, numbers, or other 
characters. However, OCR is not 100 percent accurate, and, 
particularly if the original item has extraneous markings on the 
page, unusual text styles, or very small fonts, the searchable text 
OCR generates will contain errors that cannot be corrected by 
automated means.
</p>

<p>
Although errors in the process are unavoidable, OCR is still a
powerful tool for making text-based items accessible to
searching. For example, important concept words often appear more
than once within an article.  Therefore, if OCR misreads one
instance of a key word in a passage, but correctly reads the second
instance, the passage will still be found in a full-text search.
</p>

<p>
To enable research and external services Chronicling America provides bulk 
access to its OCR data. The table below itemizes a list of data files 
available for download. Each file will decompress into directory structure that 
lets you easily map the OCR file to the URL identifier for that page. For
example a file such as <code>sn830030214/1903/05/01/ed-1/seq-1/ocr.txt</code>
maps to the URL
<code>http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn830030214/1903-05-01/ed-1/seq-1/</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in automated access to this data you may want to use the 
<a href="{% url 'openoni_ocr_atom' %}">Atom</a> and
<a href="{% url 'openoni_ocr_json' %}">JSON</a> versions of this table.
